- I don't like sexjokes, if you are that type of person then stay away from me

- I afk pony to draw, make animation, listen to music, sleep, sys etc..

- If you want to get to know me, I'm always available[don't ask me about work, family, outside relationships]

_ don't drag me into stupid arguments and blame me when I have nothing to do with it.
