# "I don't allow anyone to use my skin or style ideas without permission! If you do, please credit me."

- I don't like sexjokes, if you are that type of person then stay away from me

- I afk pony to draw, make animation, listen to music, sleep, sys etc..

- If you want to get to know me, I'm always available[don't ask me about work, family, outside relationships]

_ don't drag me into stupid arguments and blame me when I have nothing to do with it.

- I am not so rude and arrogant, sometimes i only text with friends at parties i rarely text in public

- I don't participate in many fandoms, if I do, I'm only slightly interested.

- my personality is a straightforward person,I hate to compare myself to the people I have my eyes on.Excessive or offensive talk makes me uncomfortable

- oh yeah i hate insulting my favorite character.

- My style is completely my own idea, I get very confused when someone says that I have the same style as them and get called a reference or style stealer :( . If it is the same then I am so sorry, I don't know what to do

- my fav DTR Ship ; Spamtenna . kroelle . Susel . Elnino . Syberspade . There are so many that I won't list them all.
